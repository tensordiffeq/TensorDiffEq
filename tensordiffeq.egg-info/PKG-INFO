        ## Efficient and Scalable Physics-Informed Deep Learning
        
        #### Collocation-based PINN solvers and PDE discovery methods on top of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) for multi-worker distributed computing. 
        
        Use TensorDiffEq if you require:
        - A meshless PINN solver that can distribute over multiple workers (GPUs) for
          forward problems (inference) and inverse problems (discovery)
        - Scalable domains - Iterated solver construction allows for N-D spatio-temporal support
          - support for N-D spatial domains with no time element is included
        - Self-Adaptive Collocation methods for forward and inverse PINNs
        - Intuitive user interface allowing for explicit definitions of variable domains, 
          boundary conditions, initial conditions, and strong-form PDEs 
        
        
        What makes TensorDiffEq different?
        - Completely open-source
        - [Self-Adaptive Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04544) for forward and inverse problems, leading to increased accuracy of the solution and stability in training, resulting in 
          less overall training time 
        - Multi-GPU distributed training for large or fine-grain spatio-temporal domains
        - Built on top of Tensorflow 2.0 for increased support in new functionality exclusive to recent TF releases, such as [XLA support](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), 
        [autograph](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/07/autograph-converts-python-into-tensorflow-graphs.html) for efficent graph-building, and [grappler support](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graph_optimization)
          for graph optimization* - with no chance of the source code being sunset in a further Tensorflow version release
          
        - Intuitive interface - defining domains, BCs, ICs, and strong-form PDEs in "plain english"
